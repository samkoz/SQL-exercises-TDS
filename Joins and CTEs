What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
WITH
	max_trip_each_day
AS (
	SELECT
		SUBSTR(start_date, 1, 10) trip_date,
		MAX(duration) longest_trip
	FROM
		trips
	GROUP BY 1
	)

SELECT
	m.trip_date,
	m.longest_trip,
	w.Date,
	w.PrecipitationIn
FROM
	max_trip_each_day m
JOIN
	weather w
ON
	m.trip_date = w.Date
WHERE
	w.PrecipitationIn != 0
ORDER BY m.longest_trip DESC
LIMIT 3


Can't figure out second query...also did not run the next one given I could not use small data sample and db was too big


Which station is empty most often?
WITH
  zero_counts
AS (
  SELECT
    station_id,
    bikes_available empty_instances,
  FROM
    status
  WHERE
    bikes_available == 0
)

SELECT
  station_id,
  count(*) empty_counts
FROM
  zero_counts
GROUP BY
  station_id
ORDER BY empty_counts
